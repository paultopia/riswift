TI  - THE RULE OF LAW AND EQUALITY
AU  - GOWDER, PAUL
AB  - [This paper describes and defends a novel and distinctively egalitarian conception of the rule of law. Official behavior is to be governed by preexisting, public rules that do not draw irrelevant distinctions between the subjects of law. If these demands are satisfied, a state achieves vertical equality between officials and ordinary people and horizontal legal equality among ordinary people.]

TI  - What the Laws Demand of Socrates—and of Us
AU  - Gowder, Paul
AB  - [In historical and strategic context, the argument of the Laws in Plato’s Crito should be understood not as an argument for legal obedience in general, but as an argument against the public display of legal impunity (i.e., procured by bribery). Stable democratic authority requires the threat of mass collective action in support of the rule of law. But that threat is not credible without widespread trust by citizens in their fellows’ commitment to the law. Socrates’s impunity would have undermined that trust. As a citizen with a stake in the democracy, he had compelling reason not to do so.]

TI  - Quasipublic Executives
AU  - Camara, K. A. D.
AU  - Gowder, Paul
AB  - [In this Essay, we first observe the rise of what we call "quasipublic executives": both "nominally private executives," that is, private executives in charge of public functions such as corrections, education, and national defense; and "nominally public executives," that is, public executives who have assumed private characteristics such as insulation from electoral control mechanisms. We proceed to argue that control mechanisms for quasipublic executives should be drawn from both constitutional law and corporate law, broadly interpreted. Constitutional law and corporate law both face the problem of controlling executives but use radically different control mechanisms to do so. This difference, we argue, can be justified only by differences in the institutional settings of the executives governed by each body of law or in the functions with which they are charged. But because quasipublic executives, whether nominally public or nominally private, operate in private institutional settings and perform public functions, this justification for the use of different control mechanisms cannot apply to them. Further, we argue that the law's failure to draw control mechanisms from both fields is symptomatic of a larger doctrinal distortion. Under this distortion, the solutions that the law offers to social problems are often driven more by the doctrinal field to which those problems are assigned than by functional considerations.]
